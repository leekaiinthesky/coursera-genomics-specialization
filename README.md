I'm a Community Teaching Assistant for [Python for Genomic Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/course/genpython) and [Genomic Data Science with Galaxy](https://www.coursera.org/course/gengalaxy), two classes in the [Coursera Genomics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/genomics/41).

I use this repository when posting links in the forums for those courses.
